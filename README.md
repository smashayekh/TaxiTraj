This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that answer two questions from "Trajectories of Taxis" challenge from startup.ml.

Here is the challenge: https://startup.ml/challenge

<b>Q1</b>: This dataset contains the trajectories of thousands of taxis operating in China. Your task is to read through the following  paper and produce the first graphs (distribution of distances and sampling time interval).

<b>Q2</b>: Next, please pick a trajectory for a particular trip and determine its smoothed trajectory (using Kalman filter for example or splines)
